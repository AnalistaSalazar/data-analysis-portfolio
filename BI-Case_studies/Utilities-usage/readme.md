📊 Utilities Usage Dashboard – 2024
📝 Overview

This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of utility consumption and costs throughout 2024, including:

⚡ Electricity
🔥 Gas
💧 Water supply
🚰 Sewerage
📦 Other services

Its main purpose is to identify consumption patterns, track tariff changes, and analyze total charges trends, supporting better financial and operational decision-making.

🎯 Dashboard Objectives

Analyze monthly consumption trends by service.
Compare fixed vs. variable charges.
Detect cost peaks across the year.
Measure the impact of unit price fluctuations.
Provide a solid analytical base for cost optimization.

🧠 Analytical Approach: DAX at the Core

This project relies heavily on DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to transform raw data into actionable insights.

🔑 Key Contributions of DAX in This Dashboard
1. Dynamic consumption measures

Custom DAX measures were built to calculate:
Monthly consumption
Year-to-date (YTD) consumption
Month-over-month variation

All visuals respond dynamically to time and service filters thanks to these measures.

2. Total charges calculation

DAX integrates multiple cost components into a single, consistent metric:
Fixed charges
Usage-based charges
Tariff adjustments
This ensures full alignment between detailed visuals and overall financial summaries.

3. Trend and performance analysis

DAX measures enable:
Moving averages
Trend lines
Month-over-month comparisons
These features help determine whether costs are increasing, decreasing, or stabilizing over time.
support cumulative metrics and period-over-period analysis, which are essential for financial reporting.

📈 Key Visuals

Monthly consumption by utility type.
Fixed vs. variable charges over time.
Unit value trends and their impact on total cost.
Total charges with visual trend projection.

All visuals are connected through a semantic model optimized to fully leverage DAX calculations.
